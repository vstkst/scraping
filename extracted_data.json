        "full_content": "Leading U.S. litigation law firm Morrison Mahoney is poised to completely transform its billing processes through the adoption of eBillingHub®, the pioneering electronic billing solution from Elite. Founded in 1948, Morrison Mahoney LLP has more than 170 lawyers working across 11 offices in the United States and United Kingdom, and is recognized as one of the leading litigation firms in the Northeastern U.S. It offers a diverse range of practice areas and specialisms and is particularly renowned for its strength in insurance defense work. The firm is part of global legal network ALFA International and is associated with several leading industry organizations, including the Defense Research Institute, International Association of Defense Counsel, and Federation of Insurance &amp; Corporate Counsel. The firm has been a user of 3E®—Elite’s flagship financial and practice management solution—since 2000, and the ability for any billing solution to integrate seamlessly with 3E was key in the firm’s decision-making process. eBillingHub was the right choice for Morrison Mahoney not only because of its seamless integration with 3E, but also its ability to streamline and simplify the firm’s complex and previously manual billing processes. In particular, the ability to handle large volumes of invoices was critical because of the firm’s significant insurance practice, which required the firm to regularly issue approximately 3,000 e-bills per month. More widely, eBillingHub will enable the firm to prepare, submit, track, and manage all its electronic invoices in a single web-based, user-friendly e-billing application. Highly flexible and scalable, eBillingHub also offers powerful out-of-the-box reporting and analytics which provide easy-to-read graphical reports and robust tools to better understand any billing issues and improve firm cashflow. In fact, customers using eBillingHub generally see their write-offs and write downs reduce by 50%, as well as an increase in average invoice payment time of 14 days. “Implementing eBillingHub within our firm will play a key role in streamlining and simplifying our entire billing process, enabling us to reduce our write-offs and speed up our cash flow,” said Marlene​​​​ Morris, Director of Finance at Morrison Mahoney. “In addition, the integration between eBillingHub and 3E was an important factor in our decision, ensuring seamless connectivity between our billing and financial management solutions.”",

        "full_content": "Leading Australian law firm Macpherson Kelley has taken the final step on its migration to the cloud by selecting 3E®, the market-leading financial and practice management solution from Elite. Founded in 1905, Macpherson Kelley is a full-service commercial law firm with offices in Brisbane, Dandenong, Melbourne, and Sydney. The firm has more than 140 lawyers across 20 different legal areas and a total team of 250, with a firm-wide focus on client experience and providing “law fit for business.” The firm is also affiliated with Multilaw and the Pacific Legal Network, two major international legal networks. Macpherson Kelley has reached the final step in its wider transition into the cloud across the firm, a journey it began in 2019. A 3E on-prem customer since 2010 the firm will now gain even greater efficiencies by moving to the cloud-native version of 3E, as well as benefit from increased flexibility, robust capabilities, and faster upgrades and access to new functionality. The firm will be able to remove or automate manual processes, gain real-time insights, and make use of advanced analytics to improve efficiency and decision-making, all while keeping most of their existing 3E customizations as part of the implementation. Going forward, Macpherson Kelley will be supported by a fully managed service provided by Elite, powered by the Microsoft® Azure® platform and offering cloud confidence with nearly unlimited scale, 24/7 monitoring, and advanced security that is unmatched in the industry. “The move to the cloud version of 3E, and being a 100% cloud-based organization, will enable us to be more agile as the firm grows and enable us to focus on more business enabling initiatives versus operational activities,” said Andrew Mitchell, Chief Information Office at Macpherson Kelley. “We have used 3E for years, and it was the obvious choice to provide a robust, open, cloud-based platform while keeping most of our existing customizations. Making the transition to 3E in the cloud also won’t require a substantial change management program, given our familiarity with the platform, which is a huge bonus.”",

The 3E mobile app, available for both iOS and Android, sets the foundation for bringing the power of the entire 3E® cloud portfolio to our customers, wherever they happen to be. The 3E app leverages a new Microsoft Azure security framework that relies on Front Door and Entra to provide seamless authentication and easy deployment options, allowing firms to comfortably deliver the mobile experience to their timekeepers regardless of location. The first iteration of the 3E app focuses on Time Entry, dramatically simplifying the process for busy professionals. Users of the new app will immediately benefit from: - Device-native AI enhanced dictation, grammar and spellcheck features that allow users to dictate narratives and perform searches of drop-down lists and matters - Improved calendar control that provides totals by day, week, or month, enabling a review of time by the desired period and easier editing and posting - A new auto-save function which ensures that edits are saved as they are made - An enhanced, faster loading experience that reduces wait times for matter, phase, task, and activity lists And Time Entry is just the beginning. Upcoming enhancements include better assistant (Siri) integration to allow users to start a timer or enter time from their home screen, the ability to display running timer banners on their phone and smart watch, and enhanced voice control within the application. The future 3E mobile experience will enable our customers to work seamlessly across devices, regardless of where a process or information source was started or resides. The new 3E mobile app is now available for download from the Apple and Android app stores.",

        "full_content": "Elite has announced new partnerships with cosine and Zylinc which further extend the capabilities of its flagship financial and practice management solution 3E®. These new partnerships provide the latest evidence of the flexibility, power, and potential of 3E’s open SaaS platform. Elite’s long-standing technology and implementation partnership with cosine solutions has expanded to enable cosine Matter Planning in the cloud. On-prem 3E customers using cosine Matter Planning will be able to move seamlessly to the cloud with the combined solution intact, and new cloud customers will be able to integrate cosine into their 3E solution as part of their implementation. In addition, further cosine modules will be made available later this year (Q4 2024) to 3E cloud customers as part of this expanded partnership. “Building on 3E’s powerful and flexible SaaS platform, cosine’s robust feature set and easy-to-use interface have been key to supporting our customers’ matter planning and pricing strategy, driving operational efficiency in this critical part of modern legal operations” said Lucas Garlepp, Chief Operating Officer at cosine. “3E cloud customers will soon be able to benefit from cosine Matter Planning in the cloud, and we are looking forward to rolling out further cloud-based modules later this year, extending the 3E experience.” In addition, the new partnership with passive time capture software provider Zylinc enables 3E cloud users to have seamless connectivity with Zylinc’s technology solution, which provide automatic and accurate capturing of incoming and outgoing phone calls across mobile phones and landlines. Through a new API-powered integration, call-related time and billing information from Zylinc can be logged directly into 3E by automatically matching calls with contact details from existing databases, associating the call with the specific client name and matter. Users also benefit from powerful privacy controls and options, including robust data encryption. “Being able to offer our capabilities to 3E cloud customers in a now fully integrated way will be of tangible benefit to users of both of our solutions,” said Kristine Andersen, Chief Revenue Officer at Zylinc. “Our solution is the only one of its kind on the market and plays an important role in helping busy professionals focus on what they are great at, freeing up valuable time and increasing billable hours.” Cosine and Zylinc are both members of Elite’s partner program, which consists of more than 60 technology and service providers offering essential specialisms and expertise in specific products, skill sets, or geographic regions to meet a range of customer needs and support requirements. “We are always looking for new ways to extend and flex our solutions to meet the needs of customers, and the open platform architecture which sits at the core of 3E enables such innovative solutions to be developed,” added Elisabet Hardy, Head of Product at Elite. “It is great to welcome Zylinc to our partner ecosystem as well as expand our existing partnership with cosine, in order to provide an even more seamless experience to our 3E customers.”",

        "full_content": "Leading U.S. law firm Gentry Locke has successfully moved its financial and business operations into the cloud with 3E® , the market-leading financial and practice management solution from Elite. Established more than a century ago, Gentry Locke is now the eighth largest law firm in the state of Virginia, with an 83-strong team of lawyers practicing across a range of disciplines. From its offices in Roanoke, Lynchburg, Richmond, and Norfolk, the firm helps companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals meet their legal and business challenges. In addition, the firm is affiliated with ALFA International, a legal network of more than 10,000 lawyers in 140 law firms throughout the United States and in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The firm’s solid growth trajectory in recent years had made largely manual and paper-driven processes and systems for managing its business unsustainable over the longer term. As a result, the firm selected the cloud version of 3E to enable the power of automation to transform its workflows and eliminate manual reporting. With 3E in the cloud, it has gained significant efficiencies by removing or automating manual processes, including in areas like proformas and invoicing. Thanks to the deployment of 3E, proformas are now generated, edited, and processed for invoicing significantly faster, and on a largely automated basis, which in turn will speed up the firm’s work-to-cash cycle. More widely, Gentry Locke is now supported by a fully managed service provided by Elite, powered by the Microsoft Azure® platform and offering cloud confidence with nearly unlimited scale, 24/7 monitoring, and advanced security that is unmatched in the industry. \"Moving our business into the cloud with 3E has been a major step forward for our firm, and it is already proving transformative for us,” said Frank Pittard, Executive Director at Gentry Locke. “We needed to modernize both our systems and our processes to eliminate or automate the largely manual ways of doing things. Investing in powerful technology like 3E is enabling us to better serve our clients and empowering our firm to be more efficient, productive, and profitable.” In addition, Gentry Locke has also deployed other Elite solutions which seamlessly integrate with the cloud version of 3E. These include Advanced Financial Solutions—a Microsoft® Excel® toolset with powerful reporting capabilities on productivity, efficiency, and profitability—and eBillingHub®, Elite’s market-leading electronic billing solution designed specifically for law firms.",

MinterEllisonRuddWatts is a top-tier New Zealand law firm known for its excellence, innovation, and commercially astute legal advice. The full-service law firm works with clients across a number of key sectors, including infrastructure, government, health, banking and financial services, managed funds, technology, and energy. In selecting its new financial and practice management solution, MinterEllisonRuddWatts sought a platform that would enable significant efficiencies and enhanced reporting capabilities. By deploying 3E Data Insights with 3E, the firm will gain more powerful analytics and reporting than ever before with instant, graphic reports to facilitate faster decision-making. In addition, a move to passive time recording—using the Always-on Time capability available in 3E—will enable MinterEllisonRuddWatts to capture billable activities more accurately and free up the firm’s lawyers to focus on providing an outstanding client experience and value-add activities. More widely, the robust and open architecture of 3E—built on modern, secure APIs—will enable the firm to link many of its other technology applications to 3E, helping to create a more seamless experience for users across the business. \"Moving to 3E in the cloud is the right solution to meet our needs, both for today and into the future. It provides us with a powerful platform as we continue to grow,” said Andrew Poole, Chief Executive of MinterEllisonRuddWatts. “The Elite team has outlined a robust roadmap for 3E, which is already the legal profession’s leading financial and practice management offering in the cloud. The team is clearly embracing an open architecture approach and the application of new technologies and innovation such as machine learning, both of which are really attractive to us.”",

The London event was the first official VANTAGE conference held since 2019, and it is the first of three major VANTAGE events taking place in 2024. This year’s event saw a record level of customer attendance, as well as participation by more than a dozen organizations from across Elite’s wider ecosystem of partners. As well as a keynote address from CEO Mark Dorman and Elite’s executive leadership team, delegates were provided a comprehensive overview of the product roadmap and Elite’s recently refreshed brand. Throughout the day, attendees had the opportunity to participate in more than a dozen educational and breakout sessions on numerous Elite products, as well as topics ranging from innovation and cloud intelligence to best practices for migrating from on-prem to the cloud. In addition, Elite debuted its new Premier Delivery Partners Program, which enables customers to work directly with two initial services partners—Harbor and Helm360—for delivery of end-to-end implementations of Elite’s 3E cloud solution. Over time, the Premier Delivery Partners Program will expand to incorporate additional services partners in response to customer needs. VANTAGE London 2024 took place as momentum continues to grow for the recently independent Elite business. To date, Elite products are used by 85% of the Global 100, and over 48M invoices, representing a total value of $54Bn, have been processed using eBillingHub—the market-leading electronic billing solution built specifically for law firms.

        "full_content": "London law firm Forsters has selected the market-leading financial and practice management solution 3E® from Elite as a foundational technology component of its wider ”true cloud” SaaS strategy. In addition, the firm is poised to adapt its billing processes through the adoption of eBillingHub®, the world’s leading e-billing solution for law firms. Forsters, a leading UK law firm, has a team of more than 300 lawyers and 500 professionals across multiple practice areas. In selecting 3E, Forsters wanted to develop its technological foundation and operational efficiency. The functionality of 3E is well suited to handle the firm’s needs. \"It was clear to us that 3E is a functionally rich finance solution, with standard functionality in the cloud that wouldn’t require bespoke development or customisation,” said Aamir Shaheen, Head of Finance at Forsters. Crucially, the true cloud architecture which 3E offers was aligned with the firm’s overall cloud strategy, enabling interoperability with other systems and tools through open APIs. In addition, the connectivity with the Microsoft® Power Platform® will enable the firm to build powerful, bespoke PowerApps. \"3E in the cloud is one of the very few true SaaS financial and practice management solutions applicable to law firms of our size and complexity,” said Anthony Stables, CIO at Forsters. “Cloud solutions should be able to work seamlessly with each other, and the 3E APIs and integration capabilities give us the confidence that we can develop true end-to-end automation capabilities as we move forward.” Data security was also a key factor in the firm’s decision to move to 3E. “Security is key for law firms when partnering with any cloud provider, and we feel confident that Elite is the best guardian of our clients’ data,” said Stables. Forsters will also benefit from faster, automatic upgrades which come from choosing 3E in the cloud. As well as moving to 3E, Forsters will be adopting Elite’s electronic billing solution eBillingHub, an intuitive, web-based platform which will enable an overhaul of the firm’s current approach to billing. Once implemented, all the firm’s e-bills will be managed through a single, easy-to-use interface which is integrated with 3E. The result will be streamlined billing processes, reduced time to payment and faster cash collection.",

The new program was unveiled at Elite’s VANTAGE London Conference, the first of three major customer events taking place in 2024. Two of the industry’s leading technology services organizations – Harbor and Helm360 – have joined the newly created Premier Delivery Partner Program. Both organizations have a proven track record of delivery and offer the capabilities and capacity to scale quickly on a global basis in response to customer needs. As an evolution of Elite’s strategy to deliver its leading, cloud-native financial and practice management platform, customers now can work directly with the service partner on their full cloud implementation and other post-implementation needs. Additionally, Elite will support its Premier Delivery partners to ensure successful delivery of its 3E cloud solution. Martin Linusson, Chief Customer Officer, Elite, stated, “Elite’s partners have long played a central role in meeting customer needs, and our new Premier Delivery Partner Program takes our partner approach to the next level. Our customers can now engage directly with a single partner services team throughout their entire implementation, resulting in a more streamlined, seamless and practical implementation experience. Within our broader partner ecosystem, we aim to support and enable all partners who wish to extend their capability to successfully deliver our solution, and we believe our customers benefit from being able to choose which company best suits their delivery needs.” Norm Mullock, Global Head of Corporate Development and Alliances, Harbor, said, “Migrating to the cloud requires a specialized approach and skills. Harbor provides end-to-end services that enable thoughtful planning and execution – assessing business and technology requirements, identifying the best strategy, executing on the project, and providing ongoing support and services. Our team of 70+ Elite experts has a proven track record of working with Elite’s technology and delivering successful client outcomes. We’re delighted to elevate our partnership further with Elite to deliver the benefits of cloud to 3E clients globally.” Bim Dave, Executive Vice President, Helm360, commented, \"We're excited to be part of Elite's Premier Delivery Partner Program.

Helm360's proven track record in cloud deployments, combined with Elite's innovative technology, will ensure a seamless and successful experience for Elite’s customers, regardless of their location.\" Over time, the Premier Delivery Partner Program will expand to incorporate additional service partners in response to customer needs. In addition, Elite’s broader partner program remains unchanged, with more than 60 technology and service providers offering essential specialisms and expertise in specific products, skill sets, or geographic regions to meet a range of customer needs and support requirements.",

As a newly independent legal tech company, the refreshed brand reflects Elite’s heightened commitment to delivering cutting-edge digital financial solutions to its customers, bringing together powerful data, advanced insights and intuitive tools – all on one platform – to help the world’s leading law firms drive productivity, innovation and profits for the future. The updated branding includes a new logo crafted as an ambigram, designed to appear symmetrical from left to right while still reading “Elite.” This approach draws a viewer’s eye to the center of the logo, serving as a bold iconic visual metaphor for how Elite’s products sit at the heart of the operational effectiveness of the most successful law firms around the world. Additionally, the Elite brand comes to life visually through the use of a new distinctive deep purple color and vibrant, impactful photography and imagery. “Introducing our new branding is one of the many things we are doing as we continue to focus on getting closer to our customers, delivering new, innovative products and solutions, and driving future business growth,” said Mark Dorman, CEO of Elite. “Building on Elite’s rich heritage and well-established leadership position in the legal tech industry, we want to convey our customer-centric focus and Elite’s ability to be astute, adaptive, and attentive – as we are at the heart of the world’s most successful law firms, accelerating their business and keeping one beat ahead in meeting their business and operational needs.” Elite solutions are the trusted technological foundation for a significant proportion of the world’s largest and most innovative law firms, with a customer base comprising more than three-quarters of the Am Law 200 and four-fifths of the Global 200 law firms.

Within the latest version of eBillingHub, users are able to addresses the challenge of non-uniform electronic billing rejections, by leveraging Microsoft® Azure OpenAI technology to automatically categorize rejected invoices. More specifically, law firms can easily and more quickly address rejected invoices through automatic, AI-powered categorization of the reason codes, which can then swiftly be reviewed and addressed by a biller. In addition, an enhanced dashboard is now available within eBillingHub, providing a brand-new visual presentation of the number of rejected invoices in the tracking page. Users can instantly see categorized rejections at-a-glance—both by rejection category and by vendor—and are able to click through and quickly act on the rejected invoices. Taken together, this new AI-powered categorization functionality promises to significantly streamline the e-billing workflow, enabling e-billing teams to quickly address rejections by vendor within a specific category and allowing firms to get paid faster. “We worked directly with customers to solve an important pain-point for their e-billing processes, namely, how to automate and accelerate the handling of larger volumes of rejected invoices,” said Ahad Shafiq, senior product manager for eBillingHub at Elite. “This partnership approach, coupled with the power of AI and machine learning, have provided an innovative solution which further transforms and optimizes the e-billing process.” This is the second AI-based innovation to be unveiled by Elite recently. In August, the company launched a new automated time entry capability for users of its flagship financial and practice management solution 3E, in which generative AI technology from the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service creates draft timecard narratives with just the click of a button. “This new application of AI within eBillingHub is just the latest example of how we are innovating and pushing the boundaries, in order to reduce administrative tasks and speed up business processes for our customers,” added Elisabet Hardy, head of product at Elite.",

        "full_content": "Ohio-based law firm Graham Law was an early adopter of ProLaw, the law practice management and finance software from Elite. It first implemented the solution in the late 1990s. Lawyers, paralegals, administrative, and accounting staff now use ProLaw for a wide range of office requirements, including case management, cost recovery, docketing, and time entry. Today, the firm — which specializes in personal injury and comprises workers’ compensation, disability, criminal defense, and trusts and estates practices — is still finding new ways to use ProLaw to underpin success. Why Graham Law uses ProLaw Transparent case management and cohesive functionality are two of the most significant benefits to the firm. \"It's our main case management software. Everyone uses it every day: our attorneys, our paralegals, our accountant, our support staff,\" says Wendy Ashby, Administrative Assistant. She added, “One of the biggest attractions was that the front-office and back-office functionality work together. You don’t need a separate back-office accounting system from the case management side.\" Q&amp;A with Wendy Ashby, Administrative Assistant at Graham Law What was the appeal of ProLaw? Wendy says, \"We could find all of the cases in one place and see what each other were doing. There would be less repetition – everyone could use the same forms and templates, and we’d be able to easily track what was going on in each case. Plus, it would streamline processes.\" What are the top 3 aspects of ProLaw for your firm? According to Wendy, “The case management, time entry, and cost recovery capabilities of ProLaw are extremely important. “Attorneys like the fact that they can pull up documents quickly and make changes, or if they are new to a case, they can easily see what progress has already happened so far and get up to speed quickly. They can also enter their time as they go along and keep track of their hours on each matter in a straightforward manner. “When it comes to tracking fees that a department or attorney has brought in, ProLaw makes it easy to retrieve this information. Individuals and the firm can see where we stand against goals for the year and how well we’re recovering costs.” What else do you like about ProLaw? Wendy: “In recent years we’ve started to use it more for marketing. For example, we created a custom tab in contacts to store information about how new clients found out about the firm, and the contacts database provides a vital source of information for following up on leads. We’ve built up a lot of client information in ProLaw over the last 25 years, and we want to make use of that data in our marketing. “Using ProLaw has created efficiencies by removing the duplication of effort and making processes faster. For example, adjusting how expenses or receivables are managed on the accounting side, or eliminating the need to send emails and save documents separately on the case management side because it integrates with Microsoft Outlook and Word and so on. And if an attorney goes to a conference and they learn of a new form, we can put it in ProLaw so everyone can use it.\"",
